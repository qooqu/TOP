# welcome

This is my workspace for the [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/about), an open source curriculum for full stack JS. I completed the course in March 2021 and recommend it highly.

Below, you can see some of the projects with links to the code and live sites.

## final project: bubble task

[live](https://bubbletask.netlify.app/) |
[repo](https://github.com/qooqu/bubbletask) |
simple task tracking for teams

-   full stack app, hand coded with node, express, mongo, passport, and react
-   front end hosted on netlify with CD from github
-   express app hosted on heroku, db hosted on atlas
-   heroku might take a minute to warm up
